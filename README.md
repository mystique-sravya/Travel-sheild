# TravSheild - Your Ultimate Defense Against Travel Scams
## Introduction:

I had a bad encounter with an auto driver during a recent trip to Araku. He charged exorbitant rates and took longer routes, leaving me feeling duped and annoyed. After thinking about this scenario, I came up with a novel idea to safeguard tourists from such dishonest practices and improve their travel experiences. Thus, the idea for "TravShield"—a cutting-edge mobile application created to protect tourists against scams and dishonest business practices by taxi and auto drivers—was born.

The TravShield app promises to change the way tourists explore unfamiliar areas by assuring fair and transparent interactions with drivers and making the journey as easy as possible. With the primary purpose of encouraging a safe and happy travel experience, the app includes an abundant number of features that empower tourists while also holding drivers responsible for their actions.

## Purpose and Scope:

The **purpose** of the TravShield project is to develop a web application that serves as a trustworthy travel companion for tourists visiting any tourist place. The app aims to protect tourists from fraudulent practices by auto and cab drivers and enhance their travel experiences. 

The **scope** is key features that include transparent pricing, distance tracking, verified drivers, tourist places guide, itinerary planning, offline access, auto/cab booking, emergency support, and user education.

## Project Overview

The TravShield project focuses on creating a web application that addresses the challenges faced by tourists during their trips to tourist places. It aims to provide a secure and transparent platform where tourists can plan their itineraries, book reliable transportation, and receive essential information about tourist places. The app will promote fair practices, increase trust between tourists and drivers, and ensure a positive travel experience.

## Project Specifications

### Target Audience

The TravShield application targets tourists planning to visit any tourist places, catering to both local travelers and international tourists to explore the places. The app aims to empower tourists with essential tools and information to navigate any place confidently, free from worries of fraudulent practices. The primary goal is to ensure a secure, transparent, and enjoyable travel experience, building trust between tourists and drivers.

### Technology Stack

Frontend Setup:
- Inside your project folder, create a new `client` folder to store the frontend code.
- Set up the frontend using React.js:
  - Use `npx create-react-app client` to create a new React.js project.

## Existing Projects/Systems

TripAdvisor, RoughGuides, Ola, Rapido, etc.
There are websites that provide information about tourist destinations, as well as YouTube videos that share tour experiences, and other apps that provide cab booking, car booking, and bike booking in major city areas. My app provides information about tourism attractions and also allows users to arrange rides to such attractions.

Limitations of Existing Systems

- Fraud Prevention and Safety Focus: Unlike other tourist information websites, your app prioritizes fraud prevention and safety. Features such as real-time fraud alert systems, driver integrity ratings, and user reviews increase trust and ensure tourist safety during their travels.
- Transparent Fare Estimations: I provide transparent fare estimations for each ride to tourist attractions, users can plan their budgets effectively. This feature sets my app apart as it instills confidence in travelers, eliminating worries about excessive charges or hidden fees.
- Optimized Itinerary Planning: Unlike traditional cab booking apps, my app optimises itinerary planning. Users can choose how many locations they want to visit and how many days they want to spend covering all locations. The software then generates an ideal travel schedule for them, covering attractions while saving travel time and maximizing overall enjoyment.
- Comprehensive Service Offering: While some existing applications may specialise in vehicle booking or tourist information, my app combines both services into a single comprehensive platform. This all-in-one strategy saves time and eliminates the need for users to switch between apps, improving the overall user experience.

TravShield provides a unique and important solution for tourists by focusing on safety, transparency, and user experience, as well as incorporating capabilities not usually found in existing platforms. This mix of features distinguishes your app from the competition, making it an appealing alternative for travellers looking for a safe, efficient, and user-friendly travel companion.
